The aim of this project is to implement a function in C that reads from a FD and returns the next line within the FD passed as a parameter.

This project was first done and finished in a different repo to this one (42 camps provides us with independent repos for each project). Once finished, the project was then copied to my personal repo in gitHub.

In the following pdf you can find the project requirements as specified by 42 campus:
