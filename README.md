The aim of this project is to implement a function in C that reads from a FD and returns the next line within the FD passed as a parameter.

This project was first done and finished in a different repo to this one (42 camps provides us with independent repos for each project). Once finished, the project was then copied to my personal repo in gitHub.

Yow will notice that there are some files with "bonus" written on them. This is the bonus part of the project which consists of coding the function in such a way that will not only return the next line from a single FD, but of multiple FDs. 

The get_next_line function is included in my libft library. It is not part of the libft project requirements but once you pass the get_next_line project, 42 camps allow us to use it as part of our libft functions in projects down the road. Same with the Ft_printf function.

In the following pdf you can find the project requirements as specified by 42 campus: [README_GET_NEXT_LINE.pdf](https://github.com/Alvicina/Get_Next_Line/files/15310043/README_GET_NEXT_LINE.pdf)

The following snapshot if proof that the project was succesfully done:
